### PET JS

Simple React app to manage the shift schedule of a veterinary

You can visit this app deployed [here](https://admin-pacientes.vercel.app/).

This is a program that I made as an exercise of react state management, forms, hooks and localStorage. The shifts created are locally saved in each browser by using localStorage, so you can use this app, close it and keep the data saved to use it again in another moment. Hope you like it!
